/// Manages outfit selection and rotation across categories.
///
/// OutfitPicker provides intelligent outfit selection with automatic rotation tracking,
/// ensuring you don't repeat outfits until all have been worn. Perfect for daily outfit
/// selection, wardrobe management, and style rotation.
///
/// ## Quick Start
/// ```swift
/// // Simple initialization - no configuration needed
/// let picker = OutfitPicker()
///
/// // Setup your outfit directory
/// let config = try Config(root: "/Users/me/Outfits")
/// let configService = ConfigService()
/// try configService.save(config)
///
/// // Get a random outfit from "casual" category
/// if let outfit = try await picker.showRandomOutfit(from: "casual") {
///     print("Wear: \(outfit.fileName)")
///     try await picker.wearOutfit(outfit)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Type-Safe API
/// Use CategoryReference for compile-time safety:
/// ```swift
/// let categories = try await picker.getCategories()
/// if let casual = categories.first(where: { $0.name == "casual" }) {
///     let outfit = try await picker.showRandomOutfit(from: casual)
///     let available = try await picker.getAvailableCount(for: casual)
/// }
/// ```
